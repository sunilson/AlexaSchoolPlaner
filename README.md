# Alexa School Planer

This application is only a prototype and not ready for production. It was developed for my bachelor thesis.

This app allows the user to create events like school hours, appointments or deadlines. These events can be viewed like in a normal calendar app or they can be requested via a custom Alexa skill.

Between the Alexa skill and the Android app there is a NodeJS Server that connects the two pieces with a simple Token authentication and a MongoDB.
